## Installation
This system currently only runs on MacOS and Linux.

If you are running the Compiled ASMARA Binary, skip to step 2.

### Step 1
Install Python dependencies
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-pyaudio
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2
Install other dependencies.
#### FFmpeg:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
#### Samedec:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl git
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
git clone https://github.com/cbs228/sameold.git
cd sameold
cargo install --path crates/samedec
```
> NOTE: Add RUST to path with `source $HOME/.cargo/env` after CURL, otherwise restart your terminal or log out/in before installing sameold, otherwise cargo will not work.

### Step 3
Test ASMARA's config generation by running
`python3 asmara.py -d` if using Python, or
`./asmara -d` if using compiled binaries.
> Configs will by default be stored in `.config` if not specified.
> To specify a config, add it after the ASMARA executable, and all flags.
> E.G. `./asmara -d CONFIGFILE.CFG` for a file named `CONFIGFILE.CFG`

## Configuration
DO LATER

## Usage
To run ASMARA, use the executable or the raw Python script.

For the Python executable:
```
python3 asmara.py
```
For the Compiled Binary:
```
./asmara
```

### Verbosity

If you would like more info in the terminal, you can increase the `verbosity` flag.
For a higher verbosity, run `-v`. The more `v`s you add increase the verbosity. (E.G. `-vvvv` is higher than `-vv`)

For debug info, run `-d` for debug.

For the lowest verbosity, run `-q` for quiet mode.

### Extra Flags:
`-A` gives data about ASMARA.

`-V` gives the current version of ASMARA.

`-u` updates the current version of ASMARA if there is a newer version available in the internal updater system. use `-n` to disable the internal updater for this session. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.)

`-U` sets your config file to always update if available. `-N` disables this feature, and update notifications. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.)

### Config Files:
Adding a file on to the end of the executable after all flags will set that file as a config file.
> Note: Must be a valid ASMARA config file for that version. Using an incompatible file may cause problems, and-or corruption of the said file.

Example:
```
python3 asmara.py -vvvv .config2
```
to use `.config2` as the selected config file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
> Note: The config file *must* always come after the flags. Adding a flag after the config file may result in unexpected behavior.

## Web Testing
To test the webserver, install mariadb and do the following commands
```
sudo mariadb
CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
```
then, go in web.py and change line 21 to the information you filled out for your table..
do the same for line 11-14 in userdb.py

then run the command
```
python3 userdb.py init
```

to make a user, do the following command
```
python3 userdb.py add -u username -p password

install an authenticator app on your phone, as long as it has support for qr codes, it will work, scan the qr code left in the folder qrcodes that has your username in the filename.. that is your 2FA code..,
```


To run the webserver, do the following
```
python3 web.py 
```
it should work, you can now go to the ip:port/ and it should redirect to the login page.

### HTTPS/SSL
You might've noticed that when you run the server normally, you get a warning, This is because you haven't setup HTTPS/SSL. All you have to do to set it up is run

```
python3 userdb.py mkSSL
```

And now you have a secure server, you might get a warning on a browser though, thats because it's selfsigned, but it should still be just as secure as if you got it signed by a CA
