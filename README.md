## Installation
This system currently only runs on MacOS and Linux.

If you are running the Compiled ASMARA Binary, skip to step 2.

### Step 1
Install Python dependencies
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-pyaudio
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2
Install other dependencies.
#### FFmpeg:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
#### Samedec:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl git
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
git clone https://github.com/cbs228/sameold.git
cd sameold
cargo install --path crates/samedec
```
> NOTE: Add RUST to path with `source $HOME/.cargo/env` after CURL, otherwise restart your terminal or log out/in before installing sameold, otherwise cargo will not work.

### Step 3
Test ASMARA's config generation by running
`python3 asmara.py -d` if using Python, or
`./asmara -d` if using compiled binaries.
> Configs will by default be stored in `.config` if not specified.
> To specify a config, add it after the ASMARA executable, and all flags.
> E.G. `./asmara -d CONFIGFILE.CFG` for a file named `CONFIGFILE.CFG`

## Configuration
DO LATER

## Usage
To run ASMARA, use the executable or the raw Python script.

For the Python executable:
```
python3 asmara.py
```
For the Compiled Binary:
```
./asmara
```

### Verbosity

If you would like more info in the terminal, you can increase the `verbosity` flag.
For a higher verbosity, run `-v`. The more `v`s you add increase the verbosity. (E.G. `-vvvv` is higher than `-vv`)

For debug info, run `-d` for debug.

For the lowest verbosity, run `-q` for quiet mode.

### Extra Flags:
`-A` gives data about ASMARA.

`-V` gives the current version of ASMARA.

`-u` updates the current version of ASMARA if there is a newer version available in the internal updater system. use `-n` to disable the internal updater for this session. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.)

`-U` sets your config file to always update if available. `-N` disables this feature, and update notifications. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.)

### Config Files:
Adding a file on to the end of the executable after all flags will set that file as a config file.
> Note: Must be a valid ASMARA config file for that version. Using an incompatible file may cause problems, and-or corruption of the said file.

Example:
```
python3 asmara.py -vvvv .config2
```
to use `.config2` as the selected config file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
> Note: The config file *must* always come after the flags. Adding a flag after the config file may result in unexpected behavior.

## Web Testing
To test the webserver, install mariadb and do the following commands
```
sudo mariadb
CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
CREATE DATABASE asmara;
USE asmara;
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50),
    password VARCHAR(50)
);
```
then, go in web.py and change line 21 to the information you filled out for your table..

go to line 23 in web.py and generate a **VERY** long secret key!

to make a user, do the commands in mariadb
```
USE asmara;
INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('username', 'password');
```
(NEW & required) 2FA:
Make a discord server, and a webhook, copy the webhook url and put it in web.py

To run the webserver, do the following
```

python3 -m pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy mysqlclient pytz

python3 web.py 
```
it should work, you can now go to the ip:port/ and it should redirect to the login page.
